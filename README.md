# cmake_tools

This is a collection of CMake modules and scripts that I use in my projects.

`format_all_cmake_files.py` can be used to format cmake files. `format_all_cmake_files.py` runs [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format) on all `CMakeLists.txt` files and all `*.cmake` files in the current and subdirectories.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement the cmake version of `format_all_cmake_files.py`


## Dependencies
- [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
